        <p id="short">They are easy to make, a great way to use up over-ripe bananas, and there’s no added sugar! For extra taste,
            saute the banana in a little butter until lightly caramelized before using. These pancakes are perfect to
            enjoy as a snack or light breakfast.</p>

            <li>⅔ cup whole wheat pastry flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter or oil, plus more for cooking</li>

        <ol>
            <li>In a 2-cup measuring jug, mash the ripe banana with a fork. Add the egg and enough milk to reach the 1
                cup line. Beat together until well blended.
            </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the whole wheat pastry flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Stir in
                the banana mixture, melted butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>Lightly coat a wide skillet with butter or oil. Heat over medium-high heat. Test the temperature of the
                pan by sprinkling some water into the pan — the water should sputter and evaporate immediately. Drop ¼
                cup of batter for each pancake onto the pan. Cook in batches — do not crowd your pan.
            </li>
            <li>Cook for about 2 minutes on each side or until bubbles appear on the surface of the pancakes, then flip
                and cook until browned. Serve immediately with maple syrup, butter, and/or sliced banana.</li>
        </ol>
